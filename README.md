# Design Patterns Demonstration (Exercise 1)

This project showcases **six different use cases** of Software Design Patterns in **Java**.  
It includes **two behavioral patterns**, **two creational patterns**, and **two structural patterns**.

Copy code

Each folder contains one design pattern use case with clear, separate classes.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-exercise.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd design-patterns-exercise
Compile the code:

bash
Copy code
javac src/**/*.java
Run the Main.java file:

bash
Copy code
java src/Main
📖 Design Patterns Implemented
1. Behavioral
Observer Pattern → Notifies multiple observers when a subject changes.

Strategy Pattern → Enables switching algorithms at runtime.

2. Creational
Singleton Pattern → Ensures a single instance of a class is created.

Factory Pattern → Provides an interface to create objects without exposing creation logic.

3. Structural
Adapter Pattern → Bridges two incompatible interfaces.

Decorator Pattern → Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects.

✨ Features
Modular and clean code (each class in a separate file).

Logging and exception handling included.

No infinite loops / hard-coded flags.

Defensive programming and input validation.
